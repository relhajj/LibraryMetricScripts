# LibraryMetricScripts
The PROMISE2018 release of this repository contains a script for each of our 9 metrics presented in our paper **An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons of Software Libraries**, which can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/v5hdbnywsycvt1q/LopezDeLaMoraPROMISE18.pdf). Each file contains a description on how to run the script. All scripts were developed using Python 3. For libraries whose issue tracking systems are on jira, please refer to the `JIRA` folder.

Note: Since we did not write the original version of the code that obtains the Backwards Compatibility metric, we cannot upload its code here. The code has been kindly provided to us by Laerte Xavier. Please contact laertexavier@dcc.ufmg.br for more information.

Additionally, we include a submodule called `MetricBasedComparisonSurvey` which includes the survey data collected in the same paper. To know more about the survey data please refer to the README of the `MetricBasedComparisonSurve`y repository.
