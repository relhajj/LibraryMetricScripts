# LibraryMetricScripts
This repository contains a script for each of our 9 metrics presented in our paper "An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons of Software Libraries". Each file contains a description on how to run the script. All scripts were developed using Python 3. For libraries whose issue tracking systems are on jira, please refer to the JIRA folder.

Note: Since we did not write the original version of the code that obtains the Backwards Compatibility metric, we cannot upload its code here. The code has been kindly provided to us by Laerte Xavier. Please contact laertexavier@dcc.ufmg.br for more information.
